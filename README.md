# Java-Projects
My personal collection of assorted Java Projects.

Some might be school projects and classwork, others might be side projects in Java.
Python sister repo might appear someday if I feel up to it.
Possibly also Ruby, if I want to experiment.

### Note: No repos have .class files for simplicity's sake.
The Java programs are not compiled in case anyone wants to make edits and suggestions to the program before they compile for their own use.
